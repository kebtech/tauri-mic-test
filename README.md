# tauri mic test

## To Start
- Clone Repository
- npm run tauri:serve
- may need to run npm install @vue/cli-service --save-dev

## Experience
Clicking the button will attempt to start a stream and also list all available inputs. Expectation as that all connected devices will show. This seems to show all devices but only on the locally hosted web version, not the Tauri app that is spun up.
